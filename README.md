## Project Overview:
To provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to easily filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results:
The parameters for searching the UFO sightings are divided up into date, city, state, country and the shape of the UFO. The full list is displayed until the one that is being searched is entered.

## Summary
A large drawback to this design is that unless the exact capltalization is used on the search function(in this case none) it won't show any results. Upon further development of the site I would recommend changing the capitalization needed to show the search results. I'd also recommend adding links to outside sources to show where the data came from(or at least sourcing where this list of sightings came from).
